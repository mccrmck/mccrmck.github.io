                Mike McCormick <a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(he/him)</a> is an artist and programmer working with sound, text, and visual media.
                Equally inspired by the constrained writing techniques of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo" target="_blank"> Oulipo</a> and the technomaterialism espoused by <a href="https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/" target="_blank">Xenofeminism</a>, his work combines custom algorithms with human performers and autobiographical material to explore human intimacy, male vulnerability, and our relationship with emerging technologies. 
                He grew up in <a href="https://extraordinaryyk.com" target="_blank">Canadaâ€™s subarctic</a>, lived nomadically for a decade, and has been based in Oslo since 2017.</p>

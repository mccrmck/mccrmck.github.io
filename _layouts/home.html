            <p class="home-text">Mike McCormick <a href="https://www.mypronouns.org/he-him" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(he/him)</a> is an artist and programmer working with sound, text, and visual media. Equally inspired by the constrained writing techniques of the Oulipo and the technomaterialism espoused by <a href="https://laboriacuboniks.net/manifesto/xenofeminism-a-politics-for-alienation/" target="_blank">Xenofeminism</a>, his work combines custom algorithms with human performers and autobiographical material to explore human intimacy, male vulnerability, and our relationship with emerging technologies. He grew up in Canadaâ€™s subarctic, lived nomadically for a decade, and has been based in Oslo since 2017.</p>
